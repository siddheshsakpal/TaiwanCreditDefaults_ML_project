Classification Model Performance Report.
Executive Summary:
In this TaiwanCreditDefaults report, we present an evaluation of three classification models: XGBClassifier, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression. The models were trained and tested on a dataset, and various performance metrics were calculated.
Model Performance Overview:
1. XGBClassifier:
Accuracy: 78.65%
Precision: 51.15%
Recall: 60.59%
F1-Score: 55.47%
AUC-Score: 72.16%
2. Random Forests:
Accuracy: 78.65%
Precision: 51.15%
Recall: 60.59%
F1-Score: 55.47%
AUC-Score: 72.16%
3. Logistic Regression:
Accuracy: 68.62%
Precision: 37.34%
Recall: 63.40%
F1-Score: 47.00%
AUC-Score: 66.74%

The XGBClassifier and Random Forests models demonstrate similar performance across all metrics, outperforming Logistic Regression in terms of accuracy and AUC-Score.

Key Insights:
Consistency in Performance:

XGBClassifier and Random Forests exhibit consistent results, suggesting stability in their predictions.
Logistic Regression lags behind in accuracy and AUC-Score, indicating potential limitations in capturing complex patterns.
Precision-Recall Trade-off:

While XGBClassifier and Random Forests show balanced Precision and Recall, Logistic Regression sacrifices precision for higher recall.
Depending on the specific application, stakeholders may need to prioritize precision or recall based on business objectives.
Conclusion:In conclusion, the evaluation of classification models highlights the strengths and areas for improvement. The XGBClassifier and Random Forests emerge as promising .
